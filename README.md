# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ANN
Heart Disease Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks  This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters. By leveraging a neural network model, the project aims to provide an accurate prediction that could assist in early diagnosis and risk assessment.
