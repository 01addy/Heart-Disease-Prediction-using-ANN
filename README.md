# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ANN
Heart Disease Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks  This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters. By leveraging a neural network model, the project aims to provide an accurate prediction that could assist in early diagnosis and risk assessment.
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps like data cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values to prepare the dataset for training.
Model Training: Implements a multi-layer ANN model optimized for predicting heart disease risk.
Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, offering insights into its effectiveness.
Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow/Keras for model building
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
This project provides a foundation for further improvements and experimentation in medical diagnosis using AI.
